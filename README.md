# Mini-Project 3: Steane's Code under random Pauli error

The notebook mini_project_3.ipynb takes in a boolean  $x\in \mathbf{F}_2$  and an error probability  $p$, and outputs a quantum circuit. It prepares the logical  |xL>  state using Steane's code, adds a random error for each qubit with probability  p , measures syndromes, measures the data qubits, and decodes the results.
